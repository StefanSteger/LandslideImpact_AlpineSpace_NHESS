Repo associated with the paper: "Impact-based early warning of mass movements â€“ A dynamic spatial modelling approach for the Alpine region"
doi: (will be added as soon as available)

The R code uses data from the repository to fit and analyze the models (separately for slide-types, flow-types and fall-types) and to visualize data and results.
It also contains code snippets on how certain anlayses (e.g. basin-based cross validation, variable importance) were performed

Structure of the script
-Step 1: Load data and basic visualizations
-Step 2: Fit the models
-Step 3: Calculate fitting performance and plot ROC curves (Fig. 4a in publication)
-Step 4: Cross validation: Snippet code for basin-based cross validation and visualizing final performance (Fig. 4a-d in publication)
-Step 5: Variable importance plots (incl. snippet code for calculating feature importance) (Fig. 5)
-Step 6: Visualizing partial effects from fitted models (Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8)

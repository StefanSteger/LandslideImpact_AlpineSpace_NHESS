## Overview

The R code in this repository uses the provided data to:

- Fit and analyze models separately for **slide-types**, **flow-types**, and **fall-types**.  
- Visualize data and results.  
- Include example snippets for specific analyses, such as:
  - **Basin-based cross validation**  
  - **Variable importance assessment**

## Script Structure

1. **Step 1:** Load data and create basic visualizations  
2. **Step 2:** Fit the models  
3. **Step 3:** Calculate fitting performance and plot ROC curves *(Fig. 4a in publication)*  
4. **Step 4:** Cross validation: basin-based CV and visualization of final performance *(Fig. 4a–d)*  
5. **Step 5:** Variable importance plots, including calculation examples *(Fig. 5)*  
6. **Step 6:** Visualize partial effects from fitted models *(Fig. 6, 7, 8)*
